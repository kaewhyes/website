    <h2>Quarantine sucks.</h2>
    <h5>2020-04-13</h5>
    <p>
    Many people are faced with the same issue: being stuck inside all day, doing work. It sucks. The routines we have based ourselves on have been shattered, and new (potentially unhealthy) ones have formed in place. 

    Personally, having the urge to sit around and do nothing all day is a habit that was previously broken. But now, it has returned. School used to be the thing that would keep it all in place. School used to keep me busy and out of the house until 5:00pm... That's all changed with COVID-19. The things that used to keep us occupied have been knocked out of line, and we're left with a void that needs to be filled.

    I want this to be all over. I also know that it won't be over anytime soon. I just want my normal life back.
